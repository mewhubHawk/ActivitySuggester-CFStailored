# ActivitySuggester-CFStailored
## ask her what to do and she'll ask you how many hours of high activity you have left. she'll then tailor the activity to suit your energy level. 

upon running the program, the instructions "Ask her what to do:" are shown
when something is entered, it doesn't matter what, she asks "How many hours of energy do you have left?"
if the answer is one, the answer is selected from the low energy activities dictionary, and is taken from the high energy if the answer is three. For two the answer is taken from either. if the answer is anything else, she still takes the time to "think" before snapping with a "DOn't be silly!"
every second that she "thinks" a dot for the elipsis is added

I have plans to illustrate a girl, with a PNGtuber style approach for "animating" her reactions
